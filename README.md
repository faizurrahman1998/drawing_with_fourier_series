# drawing_with_fourier_series

Using Complex Fourier Series, we can draw outlined images. Here I am accomplishing it with python. 

First, we need discrete points on the outline path we want to draw. I am using svg file to get that. One thing 
to notice is, those discrete points will create an image mirrored with respect to (w.r.t) the x-axis.
